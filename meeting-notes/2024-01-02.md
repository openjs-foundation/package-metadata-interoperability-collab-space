### Attendees: 

- Ethan Arrowood (@Ethan-Arrowood)
- Robin Ginn (@rginn)
- Wes Todd (@wesleytodd)
- Darcy Clarke (@darcyclarke)
- Luke Karrys (@lukekarrys)

### Notes:

- package.json research
  - Repo: https://github.com/openjs-foundation/package-json-research
  - PR: https://github.com/openjs-foundation/package-json-research/pull/7
  - Need to include “use cases” or “implementation details” based on npm registry.
  - Careful of implicit bias - keep language open and present details as facts not suggestions.
  - For example: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/scope#associating-a-scope-with-a-registry
  - Discussion: documenting use cases in package.json field research
    - Maybe just document how npm works, invite yarn/bun want to add their docs if they can	
- Repo for adjusting package.json info: https://github.com/npm/normalize-package-data
  - This is a legacy package
  - All package.json manip for npm has moved to https://github.com/npm/package-json
- Finish automating meeting generating: https://github.com/nodejs/create-node-meeting-artifacts/pull/144
- How can we be more actionable? 
- Many libraries exist for working with package.json
  - https://github.com/npm/normalize-package-data
  - https://github.com/npm/types
  - https://github.com/npm/package-json
  - https://github.com/npm/read-package-json-fast
  - https://github.com/npm/read-package-json
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/npm
- Tool as main function of the work = @pkgjs/create-pkg
- **pkgjs**
  - Disagree and commit - who cares if we use monorepo or not. Whoever is doing the work, make a tooling decision and lets ship it
  - Question at hand, there are two repos atm: create-pkg, and create-package-json, can they be combined into one project? 
    - https://github.com/pkgjs/create-pkg
    - https://github.com/pkgjs/create-package-json
  - Can we close out stale issues/prs?
  - What work do we need to do next?

## Agenda

* `devEngines` proposal

## `devEngines` proposal

* Presented in [#15](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/package-metadata-interoperability-collab-space/issues/15)
* @darcylarke has concerns on adding a third field and has given a more verbose explaination in [npm cli #7253](https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/7253#issuecomment-1965846137)
* @ljharb still feels this should be added regardless of it being a top level field or not, just due to functionality being applied
* @wes ??? (accurate)
* @darcyclarke engines are currently supported to various degrees by all package managers and should be leveraged because it has overlapping capabilities of the newly proposed devEngines
* @lukekarrys concerns of repurposing something that used to mean one thing that would mean somthing else that can confuse end users
* @darcy linked to npm's own docs on [engines](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#engines) and showed examples of each package managers respecting engines and erroring if the wrong engines.$package-manager is used
* @geoffrey how would using engines to specify package manager stop other package managers from being run? it could only specify all managers as top level keys in engines
* @wesleytodd specifying two ways (packageManager and devEngines) to do the same thing is a mistake and should make a hard break in favor of a single way to do something
@styfle prefers `packageManager` but `devEngines` could work too - more interested in what happens when this field is defined and what tool will actually download the package manager? corepack? something else?
## Representation

* @ethanarrowood Need more representation from other stakeholders involved to help with this effort
* Was commented that possibly timezones being an issue
